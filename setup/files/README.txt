Thanks for installing Cool!

The setup program has created this directory, which is how you will interact with the Cool interpreter.

cool: The git clone
    - cool: This directory
        - code
            - code.cool
        - config.json
        - README.txt: This file

config.json is where you will tell the interpreter what file to run when you type 'npm run main'.
By default, the interpreter will run 'code.cool', but you can change this by changing the file path in the 'input' property in config.json.

NOTE: The file path is relative to the 'code' directory in this directory.

Please keep all of your Cool files in the 'code' directory to avoid errors.

Try running 'code.cool' by typing 'npm run main'!

Have a look at 'code.cool' and try and mess around with the Cool language.
