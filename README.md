*Cool* is an interpreted programming language written in JavaScript. It is class-based and object-oriented. *Cool* is weakly typed and aims to make code incredibly concise.

The syntax and semantics of *Cool*, and even other parts of this repository (such as this README) are inspired by [Blink](https://github.com/ftchirou/blink). *Cool* also shares many similarities with JavaScript.
